Wanna know about me, README
Hi, My name is Bisrat Yonatan. I am 19 years old and currently living in the dope city of Addis Ababa.
I consider myself an open-minded individual, always open to hearing about what peope have to say and change my opinions if I hear better arguments.
Life as a computer science major has been challenging but also very rewarding, allowing me to explore a lot and have interesting experiences.
My future is bright and I look forward to see where I get to in just a few year.
